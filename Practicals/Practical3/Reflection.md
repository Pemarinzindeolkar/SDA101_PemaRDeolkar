For my Practical 3, I created my student profile using all the concepts Iâ€™ve learned in HTML so far. These include the Navigation Bar, linking navigation bars, using div classes, section IDs, paragraphing, line breaks, and text elements such as h1, h2, italic, and bold. I also learned about lists, including ordered lists, unordered lists, and nested lists.

In addition, I practiced using internal styling. So far, I have mainly applied properties such as font family, margins, padding, position, display, color, background color, text alignment, line height, borders, width, border radius, font weight, and more. These are the concepts I have mainly learned and implemented in Practical 3

One of the biggest challenges I faced was during the styling process. Since I used multiple lists ordered lists, unordered lists, and nested lists several times on the same webpage for different purposes, it became difficult to manage their styles. At first, before using div classes, I was styling the lists in a very generic way. I noticed that when I tried to change the color of one list, all the other lists inherited the same color and properties. This made it hard to give each list its own style and look. However, after learning to use classes and assigning different labels, I was able to style them individually without overlapping. This allowed me to bring more creativity and flexibility into my design.

Creating the navigation bar was also difficult for me because it is quite different from simply adding a link that takes you to another page. In this case, the idea was to work within a single page. At first, I struggled to make the navigation bar link to specific sections of the same page since I had very little knowledge about it. However, after exploring YouTube tutorials and online resources, I learned how to connect the navigation bar so that clicking on it would directly take me to the relevant section of the page. Building the navigation bar as a whole was challenging, but it became much easier once I had multiple references to guide me.
