Figma documentation 
The main concepts I applied while working on the Figma wireframe were Auto Layout and Prototyping. Auto Layout helped me structure the design in a neat and consistent way, while Prototyping allowed me to link different pages together and create smooth navigation for the e-commerce flow.

During this task, I learned better ways to organize layouts and name frames properly for easier referencing. This made it simpler to manage multiple pages and maintain clarity in the design. I also used my existing knowledge of e-commerce websites to guide the overall structure and flow of the prototype.

Through this process, I realized the importance of organizing layouts clearly and giving them meaningful names. This not only helped me but will also make the design more understandable for anyone who views it later. And by referring to multiple e-commerce websites, I was able to  build the wireframe more efficiently.

The main challenge I faced was prototyping all the pages with the correct links. Some pages required more than one linking option, which made it confusing at first. I overcame this by carefully double-checking each interaction and testing the prototype step by step to ensure the links worked properly.
